# 30 and beyond

This is a project I started right before my 30th birthday (June 8, 2016) because I wanted to start my thirties on the proper foot by becoming mindful and self-reflective.

## 12 commandments

*I need to be mindful to truly enjoy the things on my bucket list. Remembering these commandments will help me reach that potential.*

1. Worry less, let go of things.
2. Smile at people as they pass bye.
3. Loosen up, life isn't that serious.
4. Ask people follow up questions about themselves.
5. Keep eye contact while talking to people.
6. Don't fear stretching outside of my comfort zone.
7. Laugh out loud more often.
8. Don't rant even if it seems harmless.
9. Don't stop moving. Be active and stretch daily.
10. Breathe deep and be conscious of the moment.
11. Get an early start to the day, wake up early.
12. Remember that everyone is doing their best.
